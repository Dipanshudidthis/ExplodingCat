Below are the functionalities that I was able to implement successfully.
Exploding Kitten, an online single-player card game built using React for the frontend, Redux for state management, and Golang for the backend. This game features four different card types: Cat 😼, Defuse 🙅‍♂️, Shuffle 🔀, and Exploding Kitten 💣.

How to Play
Start the Game: Click the "Start Game" button to begin the adventure.


Draw a Card: Click on the deck to draw a random card. The drawn card will be removed from the deck.

Winning the Game: The objective is to draw all 5 cards from the deck without encountering an Exploding Kitten. If successful, you win the game!

Card Types
Cat Card 😼: Safe to draw, just a cute cat.
Defuse Card 🙅‍♂️: Can be used to defuse an Exploding Kitten if drawn later.
Shuffle Card 🔀: Restarts the game, shuffling the deck with 5 new cards.
Exploding Kitten Card 💣: Game over if drawn!
User Interaction
Username: Players can create a unique username to enter the game.
Leaderboard
Points: Each game won earns the player one point.
Redis Database: Utilizes Redis as a database to store user points.
Bonus Features
Real-Time Leaderboard Updates Real-Time Points: Points on the leaderboard are updated in real-time for all users playing simultaneously.
